Export, Import tool for *.apti_tex files. Plague Tale Games.

## Usage
You can use the UI version or the Commandline Interface(WIP). 

Open the app, then click export to export DDS from *.apti_tex files.
You need to edit this DDS or at least make sure to convert it through GIMP "BC3/DXT5".
Other compression support will add soon.

After your editing is done, you can use the Import button to import your DDS file to the *.apti_tex file. Simple enough.
